# vim_conf

[Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) config with [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) package management.

Includes [ALE](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) for IDE-like functionality.

Tested against Kubuntu 22.10, Pop! OS, OSX (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)); system-agnostic in theory.

## Quirks

2 space tabs, gruvbox theme.

## Installation

Execute the install script in the project root:
```
./install.sh
```
